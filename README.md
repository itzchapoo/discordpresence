# **Discord Rich Presence**
Fully customizable, open source script to create a custom, "high effort" rich presence for your server. 

The script itself is not framework dependent, but without a framework most styles currently included don't work. 

# Installation

 
 1. Create a new folder named `Discord-Presence` anywhere in your resources folder
 2. Put the script files inside of this folder
 3. Configure the script according to the config file.
 4. Put `ensure Discord-Presence` at the bottom of your server.cfg
 5. Restart your server or start the resource through TxAdmin

# Updating
Replace these files in your existing script folder:
- client.lua
- server.lua
- VERSION

And depending on the notes of a release, possibly this:
- config.lua
